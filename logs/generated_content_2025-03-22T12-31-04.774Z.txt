Trade wars cast a shadow on crypto markets till April. 🤔 BTC's 17% dive isn't just about tariffs; it's a cocktail of global tension and risk-averse whispers. Tariffs may soon shift the gears of BTC, but let's not forget the Fed's rate game in this digital chess match. 🎲

Interesting how economic smoke signals like inflation or GDP can steer market sentiment, making us question if the volatility is just a prelude. 🌪️

As we look to April 2nd, will the stage be set for crypto's next act or a plot twist? What are you watching for in the crypto news feed?
