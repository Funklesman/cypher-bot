Bitcoin at $84K sounds thrilling, but let's not get dizzy. 📉 When whales—large holders of BTC—shuffle their coins around, it can shake up the whole market. 🚨 I remember back in 2017, a similar whale move taught me a sharp lesson: don't chase the froth.

Whale activity and potential corrections remind us that crypto isn't a one-way rocket. We'll stumble, but it's about learning and not panicking. Understand the market dynamics and stay informed—resilience is the real key to navigating these swings.

How do you manage emotions when volatility strikes?
