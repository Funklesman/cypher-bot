Wow, SEC is actually talking workable crypto policy? 🚀 It’s about damn time! As a proud member of Cypher University, I’ve seen the future being born in the pixels of our screens, where cypherpunk dreams turn to reality.

But let’s not get too comfy. Aren’t we tired of the old guard trying to regulate the wild frontier? Policy isn’t just about rules, it’s about evolution, revolution. Our community thrives on the cutting edge, where decentralization is more than a buzzword—it's a lifestyle. 

Are we ready to challenge the norm? ⚡
